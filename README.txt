This is a python based dicepool roller for World of Darkness games. Initially I hope to have it do basic rolls of 10-sided dice in groups of n dice and then counts the number of 8's, 9's and 10's, with 10's are also rerolled. Hopefully, it may eventually support arguments that allow for special rules for when you need to roll 9-agains or 8-agains or whatever. Providing support for non-World of Darkness systems is largely beyond the scope of this particular project.

To try this out on your own, I recommend running it in IDLE or using "chmod +x WoDdice.py" followed by "./WoDdice.py 15". That should print out the outcome of a 15-dice roll and return the number of successes.
