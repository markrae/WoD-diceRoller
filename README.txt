This is a Python-based dicepool roller for Chronicles of Darkness games. Initially, I hope to have it do basic rolls of n 10-sided dice and then count the number of 8's, 9's and 10's, with 10's rerolled. Hopefully, it may eventually support arguments that allow for special rules for when you need to roll 9-agains or 8-agains. Providing support for non-Chronicles of Darkness systems is largely beyond the scope of this particular project.

To try this out on your own, I recommend running it in IDLE or using "chmod +x WoDdice.py" followed by "./WoDdice.py 15". That should print the outcome of rolling 15 10-sided dice and return the number of successes.
